# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        If items in this exhibit have bibliography references associated with them in a Zotero library,
        the application can display the associated references when an item's detail page is displayed.
        The Zotero library must be a public, single (non-nested) collection of reference items in which
        each item is assigned a separate tag (e.g., "gh328kv5465") for each druid associated with it.
        When an exhibit visitor navigates to an item details page, all Zotero references tagged with
        the item's druid are displayed in a named section at the bottom of the item details page.
