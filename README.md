# SUL Spotlight Exhibit template project

The project's `master` branch provides a template Spotlight application with SUL branding and functionality.

## Configuration

Exhibits need to provide the following configuration files:

* `config/database.yml` - Standard Rails database configuration
* `config/honeybadger.yml` - Honeybadger.io exception reporting configuration
* `config/blacklight.yml` - Blacklight solr configuration
* `config/gdor.yml` - gdor indexer configuration (i.e. url of dor-fetcher service and purl url basenames), use config/gdor.yml.example as a template
* `config/exhibit.yml` - Exhibit indexing directives (in addition to the indexer configuration above). It can contain environment-specific sets that should be synchronized using the `rake spotlight:reindex` task. E.g.:
    ```
    production:
      sets:
        - is_member_of_oo000oo0000
        - is_member_of_oo000oo0001
    ```

* config/initializers/secret_token.rb - Rails secret token
* public/.htaccess - An Apache .htaccess file with the necessary passenger configuration, e.g.:
    ```
    PassengerBaseURI /my-exhibit
    PassengerAppRoot /home/lyberadmin/exhibits/my-exhibit/current
    WebAuthLdapPrivgroup dlss:exhibits-admin
    ```

## Reindexing content

A rake task is provided to (re)index content into the Solr index. It uses the configured sets in `config/exhibit.yml`.

```console
$ rake spotlight:index
```

A whenever-based cron task is configured to run nightly to keep the exhibit synchronized with the latest upstream changes. At this time, the task only adds or modifies records, and does not remove records that have been deleted or disassociated with the given OAI set.

## Development

You can spin up the rails server, jetty, and populate the solr index using this command:

```console
$ REMOTE_USER="archivist1@example.com" rake server
```

`REMOTE_USER` should match the name of the user you create when prompted. This will allow you to bypass the webauth authentication.

## Deploying

You must be on VPN to deploy the worker machine.  Then deploy as usual using Capistrano:

```console
$ cap staging deploy
```

## Upgrading to use iiif images:

```console
$ rake spotlight::migrate_to_iiif[exhibits.stanford.edu]
```
